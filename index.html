			<h3>This Page</h3>
			<p>This page was an experiment in CSS Grid and Flexbox.</p>
			<p>Try resizing your browser to see how the page adapts. I love responsive design!</p>
			<p>Have a look at the CSS and HTML source if you are interested.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Not sure what this looks like in not-so-modern browsers. My apologies to those who use older browsers. NSCA Mosaic or Netscape, anyone? :-)</p>

			<h3>Greasemonkey UserScript for FritzBox</h3>
			<p>This userscript works with my FritzBox 7490 running Fritz!OS 6.90.</p>
			<p>Tested in <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey</a>, may also work in <a href="https://tampermonkey.net/">Tampermonkey</a>. Modern browsers only, as it uses <code>MutationObserver</code></p>
			<p>It adds a small button to unknown numbers in your call list, so you can do a revers lookup for that number by simply clicking on it.</p>
			<p>You can find the script <a href="/fb.user.js">here</a>.</p>

			<h3>Web Site and CMS</h3>
			<p>I created this website using Joomla and the Favourite template.</p>
			<p>The site is for a local NGO focused on fair trade.</p>
			<p>Check it out <a href="http://www.weltladen-egling.de">here</a>.</p>

			<h3>Android Native Apps</h3>
			<p>I have created a few Android apps in the past years. However, changes in the SDK slow down programmingeven further, when you already take long to finish your project.</p>
			<p>The look of apps takes at least as much effort as the functionality. And in the end I am still not quiter satisfied with the looks - I am clearly more of a techie than a designer.</p>
			<p>Last but not least, publishing an app in the Play Store is a nightmare for me. Maybe it gets easier over time. I have <i>almost</i> published a few apps, some had even gone into testing, but then I removed them again.</p>
			<p>You can find my apps <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=KiTorSoft">here</a>.</p>
